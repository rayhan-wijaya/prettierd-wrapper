prettierd_wrapper
=================

A very small wrapper for prettierd which I question its seriousness, I mean look at it it's hideous. It directly writes to a file with properly checking the exit status from prettierd. And the single script is just 30 verbose LOC.

This is really a step-down and I have some other neat bash scripts I want to show, but sadly they really need to be privated. But, hey, atleast I have one thing that's open source right?

And I also use this in my nvim config. ("HUH, wait... it is useful..! it's that is so broad! it meets, a lot of diverse needs. but, this is niche too, prettier CLI has this problem :) this is simply just the most rational and dumb way i could think of it")
