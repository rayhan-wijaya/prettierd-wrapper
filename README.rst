prettierd_wrapper
=================

A very small wrapper for prettierd--which I question its seriousness. It directly writes to a file with properly checking the exit status from prettierd. And the single script is just 13 LOC.

This is really a step-down and I have some other neat bash scripts I want to show, but sadly they really need to be privated. But, hey, atleast I have one thing that's open source right?

And I also use this in my nvim config.
